These are the solutions to the problems that I've solved regarding Data Structures on HackerRank :D

3/8 Edit: So far I've only completed two problems on the Data Structures track, both of which were easy. The Hourglass Challenge took me a while to get because at first I was trying to just code the problem without having any pseudocode but that turned out to be too difficult and frustrating for me. So then I set it aside for a while (<week) while feeling depressed and unproductive and came back to it about a week later. I found that setting a problem aside sometimes is good because I came with a refreshed view and this time I divided the problem up into smaller parts that I was able to code and used paper/pen to figure out the algorithm that I needed to solve the problem. In the end, it wasn't nearly as hard as I thought it would be, which made me happy, because this problem was supposed to be an easy problem. Things I could do better in the future is to definitely practice more, get faster at solving these problems and communicating clearly (while coding) what I'm doing so I am in essence practicing for interviews.
